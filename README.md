# kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
	The analysis was to isolate theater performances and figure completed, failed and canceled by factors of month, revenue goals, and percent completion/failed/canceled by total revenue brackets. This was done to optimise theater goals by controllable factors to avoid cancels/fails and maximize successes by revenue.

Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
	To be honest, having already being proficient in excel, I didn't use any outside resources or encounter any overwhelming challenges. I did try to overcomplicate the Kickstarter tab intentionally instead of just doing "<=[value]", I wanted to try and use drag formulas to only input each formula once and drag, but it did involve copy/pasting replacements for the goal #$ reference. I also could have copied the column text, but wanted to leave the transpose function in for reason beyond me.

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
	Peak season is May/June, October peaks in fails while simultaniously having no cancelations despite having peak Q4 totals

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	Ideal monetary goals

What are some limitations of this dataset?
	Without going into subsets of the theater section (types of plays etc, cast, etc), the most glaring limitation of the dataset would be lack of definition for goal/pledge outcomes

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	Quantifying how much a goal was missed by pledge could be an interesting study to crossreference with previous monthly data to see if changing months can viably make certain performances cross the successful threshold.
