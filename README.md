# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The analysis was to isolate theater performances and figure completed, failed and canceled by factors of month, revenue goals, and percent completion/failed/canceled by total revenue brackets. This was done to optimize theater goals by controllable factors to avoid cancels/fails and maximize successes by revenue.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Already being somewhat proficient in Excel, I didn't use any outside resources or encounter any overwhelming challenges. I did try to overcomplicate the Kickstarter tab intentionally instead of just doing "<=[value]", I wanted to try and use drag formulas to only input each formula once and drag, but it did involve copy/pasting replacements for the goal #$ reference. I also could have copied the column text, but wanted to leave the transpose function in for reasons beyond me.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Peak season based on launch date is May/June, October peaks in fails while simultaneously having no cancellations despite having peak Q4 totals.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

For outcomes versus goals, the best targets where the variance between successful and failed are 1000 to 4999 and greater than 50,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Without going into subsets of the theater section (types of plays etc, cast, etc), the most glaring limitation of the dataset would be lack of definition for goal/pledge outcomes.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Quantifying how much a goal was missed by pledge could be an interesting study to crossreference with previous monthly data to see if changing months can viably make certain performances cross the successful threshold.
